## Learning Resources

If you need to brush up on any of these topics:

| Topic | Resource |
|-------|----------|
| JavaScript fundamentals | [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/) |
| Modern JavaScript | [ES6 Features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) |
| React basics | [react.dev/learn](https://react.dev/learn) |
| React hooks | [react.dev/reference/react/hooks](https://react.dev/reference/react/hooks) |
| TypeScript basics | [typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-in-5-minutes.html) |

## What You DON'T Need to Know

We'll teach you everything about:

- **TypeScript** - We'll explain types as we go
- **Next.js** - You'll learn from scratch
- **Databases & SQL** - Drizzle makes it approachable
- **Docker** - Just copy-paste commands
- **Authentication** - Better Auth handles the complexity
- **All the libraries** - oRPC, TanStack Query, shadcn/ui, etc.

## Required Tools

Install these before starting:

### 1. Node.js (v20 or later)

Check your version:
```bash
node --version
```

Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) if needed.

### 2. pnpm

Install globally:
```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

Verify installation:
```bash
pnpm --version
```

### 3. Docker Desktop

Download from [docker.com/products/docker-desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

After installation, verify Docker is running:
```bash
docker --version
docker compose version
```

### 4. Code Editor

We recommend [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with these extensions:
- **ESLint** - Linting
- **Prettier** - Code formatting
- **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense** - CSS autocomplete

### 5. Git

Check your version:
```bash
git --version
```

Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/) if needed.

## Optional but Helpful

- **Terminal familiarity** - Basic commands (cd, ls, mkdir)
- **Git basics** - Clone, commit, push (we won't focus on this)
- **HTTP/REST concepts** - Understanding requests and responses
